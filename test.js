Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay, so it&#39;s like C3h project within progress. I plan to close it yesterday, but there are some pending stuff in styling. That&#39;s there. So I&#39;ll close it today as per the committed deadline. Other than that, Migration is in progress. Stephen is working on the New Landing Page Matilda, V2, and Husain has some feedbacks on with project. Plus, he is also working on the responsive, Styling.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Have already spoke to Husain see coming to the C3h project, right? do not update this kind these who cares at all the reason being that<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> this has been updated to 70%,<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Initiative in here. Initiatives and then we close off these ones then it becomes 70%, right? I understand that already. It has been written. You&#39;ve written over here in the work done and work to be done. But the problem is that initiators to honor chain? I like what are the other things which are left over. Like how do we know? This was the same thing, which was<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> This is the two initiatives.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> good.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay, I&#39;ll add the tracker. So, clickers and all<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> All if you want you can see if you&#39;re saying 70%. Okay, add How many other initiatives are there clothes, whichever you once you&#39;ve completed then it becomes 70%. Whichever you<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> I&#39;ll break it down.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> So die. This was called out for me in the car morning quality. The idea is like, Why how are we measuring that? Something is done this much of a percentage when there is nothing written over here and the status of these ones is not even updated.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> If you look at anything else which are there, we update the status. And that&#39;s when Dick there are things<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Got it.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> and then like there because there are five of them over here. So which means each of them is 20% and that&#39;s when you say gets closed, Everything else? Right there is a status also which they are closing right now.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> You&#39;re like, okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> So yeah, we either updated or don&#39;t update this one idea, is that if let<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> everything come in a What you say easy to understand what kind of a manner.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Then, all right. Yeah, what else is there?<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> So other than that here waiting for<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Google word.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> the PRT, that&#39;s all we have.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> um, so on your thing, okay? So c3h build something, which you are working on, and Stephen is working on which one<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> that&#39;s, Good Matilda. LP To<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Stephen is working on P2 Page, okay? P2 page, okay? And yeah, I know already about to say that that&#39;s the update for today, right?<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Cool. Okay. Um Steven anything else apart from this?<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Oh no, I am working.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> These are the<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> okay. I don&#39;t.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#008464">Tharun Jagadeesh:</strong> Well yeah so the meetings with Tacons as governance been going well create came up with a bunch of like recommendations on how we can go about doing it. All of that has been done. I&#39;ll be creating a conflict similar to this one that I&#39;ve shared here. And I&#39;ll be tacking the action items on certain individuals which are necessary for next week up. Next week&#39;s update. All of the information is available in that one place.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#008464">Tharun Jagadeesh:</strong> So that&#39;s one thing. Girish is also happy with how it&#39;s going so far. I think in another two weeks we should be good. Of how these things are done on the confluence side today, a bunch of risks have come up with respect to the, you know, like people having completed it by a certain date. So a lot of follow-ups will be happening on that aspect today. There&#39;s nothing from tachyons as for me today.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Okay coming to this, okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> oh,<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Because so let me give the context even Imran. So basically, there are couple of things which we agreed on Imran. So he basically wants us to pick up a project for one sector and then work on to it and kind of for auditor today. We are rolling out, and today I&#39;m going to talk to myth and we are going to roll out an entire Meetings recorded meeting, transcripts recorded and then preeti is going to work on getting that, whatever comes on the email into a format on confluence, it&#39;ll be in<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> tablet format. And then from two after second, the call after two calls onwards, Amit is going to continue with tracking. Everyone&#39;s updates based on the conference page, which was updated on it a day earlier and what are the status of each work and etc. So that it will have more structure into conversations in terms of when they&#39;re having discussions. So that&#39;s the format which we are going to introduce for standard calls and every meetings right now. That that&#39;s one.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Oh yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Second thing is about the tool. The AI tool the content to content is something everyone&#39;s kind of asking me. Shishank is asking, Chris is asking I&#39;m good. I&#39;ve mentioned it in the morning today telling you that this is something which everyone&#39;s being after and we need to speed upon it. So I think she might drop in the feature requests or etc. And then we will go for Taking up one tool, one will approach. And then later on we&#39;ll do the front end of it. Maybe actually in given husain&#39;s understanding of front-end, Maybe Husain can work on the front end of that. The tool whichever is going to get built up because I can pay both of you guys are anyway. Working So, the So that is a long and the other one, apart from this we will try to choose other projects. So, okay. Now coming to the third point, this is the first point first point is just identifying the tool buying and whatever which sector and give you second point is about actually<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> The reasons why?<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> putting it. If we have like we have we have now cost for some of them so I think we can start using those.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Now, the third coming to the major importance of adoption. So, this is something which we&#39;ve not been doing for a long time. Basically adoption means that making sure that the other people other stakeholders are using your product. Well, if they start using a product, well then there is a lot of feedback which they will generate. You will be able to understand if they require it or not. You&#39;ll understand if the product is good that s***** whatever. But it only it only happens when<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> someone is adopting to your product. So Scalia, what are we doing it? We are going to start doing a lot more content going forward about more content going forward. Charge GPT or automation or AI. And these are going to become blogs on blogging. Not only on conference. Right, I would even recommend that whatever you guys have published so far on landing pages in etc. Push it off to login as a blog, let everyone<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> else in the company also see.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Okay, even the product, which you guys are doing everything, like, research. We are doing or we are doing the product about the features about it. What can come out? Or even an idea, general idea like say, Hey you can use this tool for this specific purpose. I think it would be a great thing. All of these you can start writing as blocks. Yeah, I run.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah, so is there a way we can directly push to login or we need to do it manually?<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Ulated, and I really prefer that you do it manually so that you can make sure that you can your grammar and everything is corrected. Once<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> So do it manually only like wherever you&#39;ve written make sure that you do a grammar check and then push it off to this one and don&#39;t write to Lindy. Write it very, very short cut down a lot of things. People are, people don&#39;t read much of stuff. It needs to be really, really It needs to be really, really Happy to read. So I think you can run it by your own tool to get better. Output of it or you can run it by charge DVD to get a better route profit but the idea is to start keeping content.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay good.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> As much as possible. So that is the idea. The blogs are the idea which can come through. yeah, so that not only that you can also start Using that as an output for generating ideas or on query or discussions on the rest of our groups as well. So that people start adopting to it. Like if you are mentioning tomorrow onwards, if you are mentioning your Anyone asked about a content, you should only be pitching your content tool right now. Going forward after the after one more week of development, we are only pitching that product to the rest of them. No, other product. We are not even talking about them using chatgy between. Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> So, you had a very good idea previously of or quite dark search. Are we like going to take it up? Like, what, what is the plan regarding that? Because that will be really useful for everyone.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> so, there is so this is there&#39;s a long Lengthier deeper discussion which is happening on that front right now which I can&#39;t unfortunately, disclose at the moment let those things kind of get formalized a little bit and then even before me, I think you will only know, get everyone will get to know about the answer directly. It will become very evident if those<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> transitions happens. And this is not only me, it&#39;s your Broadway transition something, which they&#39;re trying to do. So if that happens, then I don&#39;t think we have to build it if that doesn&#39;t happen. I think by then some kind of solution will already exist with the current AI tools, which are having It so I, yeah. So that was it was a beautiful idea somewhere around March maybe. now, it&#39;s becoming thinner and<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> thinner because of the kind of advent of number of things, which happened So, let&#39;s see, let&#39;s see if there are just changing the direction.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Then I think the answer is anywhere available if the organ is not changing the direction and we think about what to do, but it&#39;s there on management&#39;s table. Yeah, right.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> so,<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#008464">Tharun Jagadeesh:</strong> but also, previously, tried on this<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Right.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#008464">Tharun Jagadeesh:</strong> imranulia search<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah. Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#008464">Tharun Jagadeesh:</strong> if there was some You know, progress need on it. But then we bought<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Calculate is quite costly. No, like the church. You can also think about it last<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> No, it wasn&#39;t costing us much.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> search.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> It was costing us. On an Arguide, it would wear posted as $10,000 per month or something. That<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> One of the challenge. I can think here is funny like lots of dogs are classified among certain groups. Those are not open for all. So, it will be a challenge to<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> No, no, that&#39;s not a challenge. That&#39;s actually how it is designed if it is not classified for you. It is not clarified. You&#39;re not supposed to look at some<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> documents, if it&#39;s not like, if it&#39;s classified. You know, Google Drive. Right, but even I can&#39;t see some of the documents right now.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Are looking forward. Okay, so this is regarding all the<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> They have.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> publicly available docs, right?<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> A publicly available. Second thing is sometimes you don&#39;t<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> know that it is publicly available. That&#39;s also the major problem, like<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> seeing a lot of people do not know<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> that they can search for a lot of Company content online on G drive itself.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> So that&#39;s also something which can help people, I believe So anyways, these are multiple things, okay? Coming back to this topic right on the adoption piece of it. So we are talking about blogs, we are talking about mentioning in the blog groups and etc. We are actually mentioning about the tool itself as such and we should find any other way in terms of people adopting to the<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Mean.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> product more often and it only only, when people adopt to the product is, when your product is actually getting any kind of Good or bad attention as such it&#39;s required. So I think we need to start moving into that direction going forward.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> So these are the two things about at least on this one. Now, we are going to do a lot more about other miscellaneous tools. We are going to explore the I&#39;m going to we&#39;re I&#39;ve already created one chat GPT version on DirectX email, ID, or either that or we are going to create another email ID and we&#39;ll keep it open for the rest of these people over here in this forum so that people can start using it for their experimentations or any kind of ways. Make sure that you&#39;re not uploading any direct documents or private documents, which has sensitive information about the company, apart from it, you can use it for whatever reasons for your landing pages, for you. Finding out if SEO words are correct or not, you use it. I don&#39;t have a problem. You can start using the plugins. You can discuss about these plugins on the group itself and start using it. Please go ahead and do because we require a lot of people to start adopting to this much faster. Right? I we want to really get rid of all the smaller attribute things which can, which can be done better or not tools or which can be done better. Otherwise rather than a person wasting his time or etc. So WordPress scale you can build an entire word the site in five minutes of time including the back and for completely through using Chad GB right now. If that is, if you cannot do it, then I&#39;ll try to record it tutorial and send it off to you guys. So basically, there is a lot of hope in this. You can use a lot of plugins with Jackie video, which are open with<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Again, what are you different to<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> words right now. Landing pages right now. So I think we need to start using it very very anything which is about important about code. Please do. Not hesitate to flag it. There is a budget which we have. Now we can buy certain number of licenses, so make sure that anything which is about cohort, which is miscellaneous, which people can actually use it. And etc, make sure that you fly immediately Right? And I want everyone to, in the group to start using it. The plugins right away, right? Even by the way, everyone has a few, can get a free account on charity, as well as bad part is free for everyone. Right.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> which? I mean,<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Okay. Landing pages. Guy plugin looks up to you can directly use plugins for landing pages, right? You can use Website. Clear, this one right now there are multiple use cases. Right. Anything<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Chrome plugin. Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Chrome plugins and even with the chat videos, you can start using the plugins.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> There are few plugins, which are open even with 3.5 So you can use them, which is free version, which you don&#39;t require anyone&#39;s this thing. Anyone&#39;s a permission to. So start using them at your work, don&#39;t upload any documents of sensitive, sensitive prime apart, from it, whatever you want to do. In terms of like you can copy paste, some of your code and get the full version of that code as well. So if you want to do it, do it. The idea is If you like it, just make sure that you tell everyone in the view. Share your knowledge so that everyone else in the group also will start using it. Okay. I would my I am exploring a lot.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Can we keep it a centralized dog or conference page where we can probably, whenever we discover something, we can love it so that it&#39;s easier to come back and<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> There is something called as we can go to conference under conference, there is something called as AI tools research, something in our Divx page, you can find that page, you can start<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> editing it. Everyone can edit everyone, in this group can edit all the seven people, Okay, edit right down the different<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> aspects, which you think it&#39;s? So feel free, use it. Completely make sure that you are telling everyone what you&#39;re using as such so that we can also start using it. I am trusting that everyone knows what is privacy and what is security that is only thing which you need to keep income. You know, keep a little bit about but apart from it if you&#39;re not sure about a tool just being on the group that is that what I want to use? I&#39;m not sure about it. The only thing which I would do is that I&#39;ll go to the documentation or if you use and try to read about where the content is getting stored in. The content is not getting stored over there in a continuous way. And the content is sensitive, then we use it. It is getting stored. We not, we don&#39;t use that&#39;s it. We use it, maybe. You break that code and then you use it, you don&#39;t upload it, entire code to something. All right. I&#39;m again, reiterating, we have budget, we can use it, but the thing is, I need to know. About everyone&#39;s use cases and I want everyone to start using. In any kind of a manner, which you right?<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> So as I start, we can have access to APIs. Currently, I am using my own and The building is on me, but for all the research and all the development, we can probably have API from. I mean, from Zeta, which we can use which Preeti and I can you, I have even shared my personal API with pretty So if that can be, I&#39;m enrolled out, it would be great.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Okay, so one thing with the I whether I can give the Divx car APIs to you guys. The but the one thing is which you need to remember is you cannot keep it in anything open because when you keep it in the open domain, the API gets locked<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah, that will take care of.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Okay, if you unless you don&#39;t do that, you can use the device APIs right away and start putting, I&#39;m like using it in your project. So, Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> We&#39;ll keep a hard limit and soft limit on billing. Also funny, for example per day, it<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> I have already done that, I already<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> should not.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> done that, and I&#39;m going to increase<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> the billing a little bit as well, based on the use cases right now. It&#39;s at a very low level, but if you guys are using it more and disabled, and I increase that band limit as<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> well, that&#39;s not a problem. well,<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Sure.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> So we have my thing is to see that everyone over here is using somewhere here. like, I won&#39;t have not heard the voice of Husain steep and so so far from this, I want you guys to mention that this is something which we&#39;re using, or this is helpful. This is how much it&#39;s going to be used in etc. On a very decorative. All right.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> I mean, today&#39;s gertripated others in dimensions. He&#39;s asking about it. It&#39;s your feedback and you. Yeah. You know, tell him. It&#39;s<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> so, anyways, your card what I said,<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Yes, you can talk to Imran.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> You know.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> Going forward for every work of yours. I want to see timeline reduction in every project which we are doing at the moment, right? Now, landing pages are taking two days of time. I want that to be reduced to literally a day of time. Okay, SEO keywords. It&#39;s taking two days of time. I wanted to be reduced to one day of time. So essentially we use things to make sure that yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> So regarding learning pages. Funny. The idea is to deliver the I mean I made a soft promise of delivering it yesterday but I said that the deadline is today, but issue is that we are getting repeated changes. So that&#39;s one thing which drugs<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> I am. That is, that is something that is at a functional level, which we need to attack it. And we will do with the idea which I&#39;m talking about right now is that Are you using these ones to reduce your timeline or not? Whatever you spending hours, right? Okay.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#bd7d00">Imranul Mazumder:</strong> Yeah.<br><strong style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:22px;color:#0079d1">Phani Marupaka:</strong> The iterations. The feedback and everything that will. Yeah, those are innate inevitable. But at least How much time you are spending on something at a stretch. When you have the changes given to you is what I am, sorry about, like, Can you reduce that number of hours? How much can you reduce it? How much is it helping you? If do you require any other assistance to help you out? Much better that? Okay. All right, so I I hope that everyone understood where we are taking up where we are going with this discussion and hope that everyone&#39;s going to be more active in terms. Right. Thanks. I I can hear a lot of background noise. I think I better drop it. See you guys. Bye.
